## Scraping Procedure
In this project, Selenium was used to scrape the data from a various number of webpages.

The webpage shown above contained a list of indivudal links, pointing to other webpages that contained html tables filled with UFO reports. My script went through every link one-by-one, scraped every html table cell, and grouped them in their proper rows. This scraping script took about 4 hours to complete and scraped about 100,000 total reports.

Each row contained the columns:
- Date / Time
- City
- State
- Shape
- Duration
- Summary
- Posted

# Data Cleaning

The cleaning process of the project consisted of
- Seperating the 'Date / Time' column into its very own columns
- Reformatting the 'Date' and 'Time' columsn
- Clearing rows with unusual
- Clearing all rows with any NaN present
- Dropping the 'Posted' column
- Regrouping values with differnet capitalizations (e.g. 'lights' and 'Lights')
